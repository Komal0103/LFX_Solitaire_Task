## Introduction
This is currently an incomplete implementation of Solitaire card game implemented in Qt. The following points summarize the work completed till now:
* Classes `Stack`, `Foundation` and `CardPile` inherit from class `Card`. These are the main 'components' of this game.
* Implementation of `Stack` is complete with drag and drop functionality, stack flipping.
* `Foundation` is incomplete - it is unable to accept drop for some reason.
* `CardPile`, too, is partially complete.

## Build Instructions
* Install Qt from the [online installer](https://www.qt.io/download-open-source) and follow the instructions to install the Open Source version. One may also refer this [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjApF6qnyUI) for installation.
* The build system is chosen as CMake.
* Open the project in Qt creator and run the application.

### The documentation will be found on the main branch. This project is under development and further commits will be on this branch until everything works.
